DripLS

Prerequisites
==================

Currently DripLS runs on linux based systems, as it makes use of iptables/netem.
In future it is possible to enable DripLS to run on BSD based distros via ipfw.

Basic Installation
==================

To setup DripLS :

1. Make sure iptables is available and kernel is compiled with netem support.
   This should be the default on most linux systems.

2. Make sure the user running the service has sudo rights

3. Install nginx

4. Copy the configuration sites for nginx from conf/nginx/. Make sure to include
   them in the nginx config.
   
5. Execute fab local deploy so that DripLS can setup its components, or make a new 
   target in the deploy/fabfile for the remote server on which to deploy Dripls

6. ps aux | grep dripls on the target server to verify the app is running

7. curl "http://<dripls-host>/master.m3u8?authkey=sample&cid=wt&r=650k.s0~e404" and
   make sure there is a valid response

Custom Adapter
==================
To extend the DripLS functionally to handle specifics of your HTL server, extend
HttplsProvider in conf/data.py
